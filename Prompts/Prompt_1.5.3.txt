Please transcribe all herbarium label details carefully following these explicit rules:

- Do not include periods (.) at the end of fields.
- Explicitly insert "N/A" if information is missing.
- Write exactly "unsure and check" if any detail is unclear.
- Never translate or interpret—transcribe exactly as printed.

Follow precisely the formatting and field order below:

verbatimCollectors:  
Transcribe collectors exactly as printed. Include prefixes ("leg.", "coll.") only if explicitly visible on the label.

collectedBy:  
Transcribe ONLY the first listed collector's name, formatted as initials (with spacing) followed by last name (e.g., R. A. Maas). Omit prefixes unless explicitly visible.

secondaryCollectors:  
List any additional collectors exactly as printed on the label, formatted as initials followed by last name. Separate each clearly listed additional collector by a pipe ("|"). If the label uses "and", retain exactly as printed.

recordNumber:  
Exactly transcribe the collection number. If none, insert "s.n." precisely.

verbatimEventDate:  
Transcribe exactly as printed without alteration. If missing, insert "s.d.".

minimumEventDate:  
Convert to ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), inserting "00" for unknown days/months.

maximumEventDate:  
Only use for clearly indicated date ranges. Otherwise, insert "N/A".

verbatimIdentification:  
Exactly transcribe the original identification, including taxonomic authority names, qualifiers, hybrids, uncertainties, precisely as printed.

latestScientificName:  
Provide the full scientific name exactly as presented on the label, including clearly printed authorities (names of persons, initials, or abbreviations after the Latin binomial). Do NOT omit these authorities.

identifiedBy:  
Provide the identifier’s name formatted as initials and last name (e.g., R. A. Maas). Include only names explicitly indicated by "det." or "determined by". Insert "N/A" if absent or unclear.

verbatimDateIdentified:  
Transcribe exactly as printed or insert "N/A" if missing.

associatedTaxa:  
Transcribe exactly as printed, preserving all conjunctions ("and"), "sp.", or abbreviations exactly as listed. Do not add pipes unless explicitly printed.

country:  
Transcribe exactly as stated on the label. If abbreviated, convert clearly identified abbreviations to current full country names.

firstPoliticalUnit:  
Transcribe exactly as printed, excluding administrative descriptors ("Province", "State") unless explicitly included on the label.

secondPoliticalUnit:  
Transcribe exactly as printed if clearly indicated; otherwise, insert "N/A".

municipality:  
Transcribe exactly as explicitly named; do not guess. Insert "N/A" if absent.

verbatimLocality:  
Precisely transcribe original locality text. Do NOT omit or abbreviate political units, measurement units, or conjunctions if explicitly included. Exclude coordinates and elevation.

locality:  
Transcribe verbatim locality exactly, fully writing out units (e.g., "miles", "meters", "feet"). Do NOT shorten, omit, or abbreviate unless printed exactly so on the label. Insert "[precise locality unknown]" if unclear.

habitat:  
Transcribe exactly as printed. Include all explicit botanical details or associations. Do NOT summarize or omit explicitly written details.

verbatimElevation:  
Exactly transcribe as written, including exact abbreviations ("m", "msnm", "ft", etc.). Insert "N/A" if absent.

verbatimCoordinates:  
Exactly transcribe as printed, including spacing, punctuation, and directional letters. Insert "N/A" if absent.

otherCatalogNumbers:  
Precisely transcribe stamped or printed catalog numbers only, excluding extraneous text. Separate multiple numbers explicitly printed separately with pipes ("|").

originalMethod:  
Categorize strictly based on visual clarity:
- "Handwritten": entirely handwritten
- "Typed": entirely typed
- "Mix of Handwritten and Typed": explicit and clear combination
- "Unsure": not clearly discernible

typeStatus:  
Transcribe exactly as printed (e.g., "Holotype", "Isotype", capitalized exactly as on label). Insert "no type status" only if explicitly absent.

Follow each rule exactly, transcribing only precisely visible text without interpretations or omissions.
